# Ready Player Me Plugin :runner:

Allows user to choose a Ready Player Me avatar as their in-world avatar.

## :hammer: Installation

You can install the Ready Player Me plugin the same way you install any plugin
into your WordPress website.

Before adding the plugin to your WordPress website, you need to build the plugin.
You can do this by running the following command from the root of this repository:

```bash
npm run build
```

Once the plugin has been built, you should see a `dist` folder and a file `metapress_ready_player_me.zip` inside the folder.

To install the plugin into your WordPress website, you can do the following:
1. On your WordPress dashboard (usually `/wp-admin`), click "Plugins" in the left sidebar
2. Click the "Add New Plugin" button at the top of the page
3. Click the "Upload Plugin" button at the top of the page
4. Choose the `metapress_ready_player_me.zip` file that was generated earlier
5. Click the "Install Now" button
6. Click the "Activate" button

All set! :tada:

## :thinking: Selecting Avatar

To select a Ready Player Me avatar, you can do the following:
1. Inside your world, click the settings icon (cog) in the left sidebar
2. Click on the "Avatar" field
3. At the very top-left, you should see "Ready Player Me"
4. Click on "Ready Player Me"
5. Customize an avatar or choose from an existing avatar if you have already logged in

Done! You should now see your avatar in the world :rocket:
